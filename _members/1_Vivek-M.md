Hello!\
I am working as an Assistant Professor at Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, India.
Before this, I was a SERB Ramanujan Fellow at Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, India..
I am an observational astronomer. Currently, my focus is on studying the variability in quasar outflows using SDSS-IV data.
My broad research interests are in active galactic nuclei, supermassive black holes and machine learning techniques in astronomy.

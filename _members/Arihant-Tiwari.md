About Me
======

I am a graduate of IISER Bhopal with a Physics major and a Data Science minor Masters degree. Currently, I am working as a researcher specializing in quasars and machine learning in astrophysics at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics with Dr. M Vivek.

Research Interests
======
I work at the intersection of computational astrophysics, modeling, spectroscopy, data drive astronomy, and machine-learning applications in astrophysics. 

My current research areas include:
- Quasar spectroscopic anomaly detection from SDSS data.
- Finding a groupings scheme for BAL variability patterns.
- Characterization of anomalous quasars through multi-wavelength astronomy.
- SMBHs and evolution of primordial galaxies.

Details about my work can be found at "[Projects](https://arihanttiwari.github.io/portfolio/)".

Education and Training
======
I have had the chance to do my BSMS Dual Integrated degree at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal. I also got research training through internships at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, India, McMaster University, Canada, Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço, Portugal, Raman Research Institute, and IIT Bombay, India.

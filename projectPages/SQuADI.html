    <p>We present the results of applying anomaly detection algorithms to a
quasar spectroscopic subsample from the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog,
covering the redshift range of 1.88 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 2.47. A principal
component analysis (PCA) was employed for the dimensionality reduction
of the quasar spectra, followed by a hierarchical k-means clustering in
a 20-dimensional PCA eigenvector hyperspace. To prevent broad absorption
line (BAL) quasars from being identified as the primary anomaly group,
we conducted separate analyses on BAL and non-BAL quasars (a.k.a. QSOs),
comparing both classes for a clearer identification of other anomalous
quasar types. We identified 2066 anomalous quasars, categorized into 10
broadly defined groups. The anomalous groups include:
C iv Peakers: quasars with extremely strong and narrow C iv emission
lines; Excess Si iv emitters: quasars where the Si iv line is as strong
as the C iv line; and Si iv deficient anomalies: which exhibit
significantly weaker Si iv emission compared to typical quasars. The
anomalous nature of these quasars is attributed to lower Eddington
ratios for C iv Peakers, supersolar metallicity for Excess
Si iv emitters, and subsolar metallicity for Si iv deficient anomalies.
Additionally, we identified four groups of BAL anomalies: blue BALs,
flat BALs, reddened BALs, and FeLoBALs, distinguished primarily by the
strength of reddening in these sources. Furthermore, among the non-BAL
quasars, we identified three types of reddened anomaly groups classified
as heavily reddened, moderately reddened, and plateau-shaped spectrum
quasars, each exhibiting varying degrees of reddening. We present the
detected anomalies as an accompanying value-added catalog.</p>

<h1 id="sec:intro">Introduction</h1>

<p>Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that are characterized as quasars are
highly luminous galactic cores powered by gas accreting onto a
supermassive black hole, emitting radiation across the entire
electromagnetic spectrum [@{1973A&amp;A….24..337S}]. They emit radiation
through various physical mechanisms contributing to their broadband
spectrum. Thermal emission from the accretion disk includes X-rays from
hot inner regions and optical/UV light from cooler outer areas.
Synchrotron radiation, produced by relativistic electrons spiraling in
magnetic fields, is prominent in radio-loud AGNs and spans radio waves
to X-rays. Bremsstrahlung radiation occurs when electrons decelerate
near ions, emitting X-rays significant in hot gas regions such as the
corona or narrow-line region (NLR). Inverse Compton scattering in the
corona boosts low-energy photons to higher energies via interactions
with high-energy electrons, contributing to X-ray and gamma-ray
emissions [see, e.g., @Begelman1984; @haardt1991; @koratkar1999 for a
review].</p>

<p>The UV spectrum of an AGN often follows a power-law distribution,
expressed as $F_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$, where the spectral index,
$\alpha$ typically ranges from 0.5 to 1.5. The power-law continuum
arises from the superposition of multiple blackbody spectra emitted by
the accretion disk’s varying radial temperature zones. Additionally, the
UV emission exhibits strong emission and absorption lines with broad and
narrow components, often modeled using double or single Gaussian
profiles. These lines involve ions such as C iv , Si iv , Al iii ,
Mg ii , and He ii . They serve as key diagnostics of the physical
conditions in the AGN’s environment [e.g.,
@zheng1997composite; @brotherton2001composite; @{2016AJ….151..155H}].</p>

<p>Due to the multiple physical processes involved, quasars exhibit a wide
range of properties that can differ greatly from one quasar to another,
or even over time within the same quasar [e.g.,
@wilhite2005; @2012MNRAS.421L.107V; @2012MNRAS.423.2879V; @lamassa2015; @green2022time].
In UV spectra, features such as the spectral slope and the strength of
emission lines display significant variability among quasars. Processes
such as gravitational lensing and obscuration by gas clouds along the
line of sight also contribute to this spectral variability [e.g.,
@wiklind1996redshift].</p>

<p>Several past studies have revealed the presence of a variety of unusual
quasar spectra that deviate significantly from the standard SED such as
the @{2001AJ….122..549V} composite. Such studies have also confirmed
the existence of unusual or anomalous quasar types. For instance,
@plotkin2008large presented a sample of unusual BL Lac objects
analytically selected from SDSS DR5, while @diamond2009high identified a
sample of 74 high-redshift quasars ($z&gt;3$) with weak emission lines from
the SDSS DR5 and @hines2001hubble analyzed two unusually
spectro-polarized QSOs. @artymowicz1993metallicity studied the AGN
metallicity as a function of unusual star formation activities at high
redshifts. Two “extraordinarily red” quasars have been found and their
dust reddening is characterized by @gregg2002reddest from the Faint
Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey.
@collin2002quasars studied the disc dynamics and supermassive blackhole
(SMBH) mass of a quasar population with super-Eddington accretion.
@hall2002unusual identified 23 unusual broad absorption line (BAL)
quasars with diverse properties, including a quasar with the most
recorded absorption lines and others with complex Mg ii  absorption
patterns. Additionally, they found rare cases of low-ionization broad
absorption line (LoBAL) quasars and iron low-ionization broad
absorption-line (FeLoBAL) quasars with strong Fe II emissions, along
with unique cases of Fe III absorption without Fe II. Studying unusual
quasar spectra is important as it can reveal physical processes or
environmental factors that are not apparent in typical quasars. These
unusual characteristics may result from enhanced mechanisms such as star
formation, accretion activity, reprocessed emission, outflows, or
feedback. By examining these outliers, we can gain valuable insights
into the diversity of quasar properties and improve our understanding of
the underlying physics governing quasars.</p>

<p>With the massive number of quasars being discovered every day, it is
likely to miss out on an extremely interesting or rare object that might
get covered in the pile of data being pumped by survey telescopes all
around the world. Machine learning serves as a golden tool in this
scenario as it can be used to quickly pick out anomalous or
weird-behaving objects (quasars in this case) from all of the “normal”
samples. Several studies have focused on detecting peculiar objects from
large datasets, with some specifically using spectra for anomaly
detection. For example, @meusinger2012unusual identified around 1,000
spectroscopically unusual quasars in SDSS DR7 using Kohonen Maps, while
@REIS2021100437 evaluated the effectiveness of various outlier detection
algorithms applied to SDSS galactic spectra. Similarly, @refId0
extracted a sample of spectroscopic anomalies from the All-Sky
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (AllWISE) Sky Survey.</p>

<p>The high dimensionality and complexity of astronomical spectral data
hinder the effective application of anomaly detection algorithms. In
such cases, a principal component analysis (PCA) can offer a robust
method for dimensionality reduction. This technique transforms the
original spectral features into a lower dimensional space, retaining the
most critical variance in the data. The efficiency of PCA in
preprocessing data for clustering algorithms such as k-means is
well-established. PCA enhances the clustering process by reducing noise
and irrelevant variations, allowing k-means to operate more effectively
on transformed data. Several pioneering studies have demonstrated the
power of PCA in analyzing quasar spectra. [@francis1992objective]
introduced one of the first objective classification schemes for quasar
spectra using PCA, highlighting its ability to extract dominant spectral
components. [@boroson1992emission] conducted one of the earliest
systematic applications of PCA in quasar studies, identifying two
principal components that encapsulate the primary variations in quasar
spectra. Their analysis revealed that the first principal component
correlates strongly with the strength of Fe II emission and [O III]
$\lambda5007$, defining an “eigenvector 1” parameter space that later
became fundamental in quasar classification and AGN unification models.
This pioneering work demonstrated the power of PCA in reducing the
complexity of quasar spectra, while preserving key physical correlations
and laying the groundwork for subsequent studies in quasar spectral
analysis. [@yip2004spectral] expanded upon this by applying PCA to a
large sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars, demonstrating
how eigenspectra capture variations due to redshift and luminosity.
[@suzuki2006quasar] further refined the approach by focusing on
PCA-based classification of quasar emission lines in the Ly$\alpha$
forest, enabling a better understanding of quasar spectral diversity.
[@paris2011principal] applied PCA to high-redshift quasar spectra,
revealing significant variations in UV spectral properties, while
[@ma2019spectral] used PCA to analyze the H$\beta$ region of
low-redshift SDSS quasars, providing insights into the spectral
diversity of broad-line regions (BLRs).</p>

<p>Beyond quasar classification, PCA has proven to be an effective tool for
anomaly detection in large-scale astronomical datasets. @Xiong2018 and
@henrion2013casos demonstrated that PCA-based feature extraction
improves clustering performance by filtering out noise and focusing on
the most informative spectral variations. By transforming spectra into a
lower dimensional representation, PCA allows anomaly detection
algorithms to operate more efficiently, distinguishing rare or unusual
sources from the general population. These studies collectively
highlight the importance of PCA not only in quasar spectral analysis,
but also in facilitating robust anomaly detection methodologies in large
astrophysical datasets.</p>

<p>In this study, we applied a hierarchical k-means clustering approach to
detect and analyze spectroscopic anomalies in quasars from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey: Sixteenth Data Release Quasar (SDSS DR16Q) catalog
[@Lyke_2020]. We chose the k-means algorithm due to its
interpretability, which makes it easier to identify which
characteristics of the data contribute to cluster formation. While more
sophisticated algorithms might offer marginal improvements in clustering
accuracy, they are often computationally expensive and more challenging
to interpret, making k-means a balanced choice for efficient and
meaningful analysis. K-means works effectively when combined with PCA,
which reduces the dimensionality of the data, keeping only the most
important variance. By leveraging PCA for dimensionality reduction, we
are able to distill essential features from the high-dimensional
spectral data, enhancing the ability of the k-means method to identify
anomalous quasar spectra. The clustering process groups similar spectra,
allowing for the detection of outliers within each cluster, which are
considered anomalous. Given the large sample size, hierarchical
clustering further refines the data into subgroups with distinct and
consistent property trends, enabling a more detailed analysis of quasar
spectral anomalies.</p>

<p>The Spectroscopic Quasar Anomaly Detection (SQuAD) project aims to
detect spectroscopically anomalous quasars from large-scale
spectroscopic surveys and conduct follow-up studies on the most
interesting cases. This paper is the first in a series, with a focus
specifically on identifying these anomalies in the rest-frame UV spectra
from the SDSS DR16Q catalog.</p>

<p>The present paper is organized as follows: In Sect.
<a href="#sec:Data">2</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”sec:Data”}, we describe
the sample selection, data reduction, cleaning procedures, and
dimensionality reduction using PCA. In Sect.
<a href="#sec:Clustering">3</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”sec:Clustering”},
we cover our clustering techniques, including k-means and its
hierarchical application, along with the methods we used for determining
the optimal number of clusters. In Sect.
<a href="#sec:Results">4</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”sec:Results”}, we
present our main findings, with visual representations of the detected
anomalies. In Sect. <a href="#sec:Discussion">5</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”sec:Discussion”}, we categorize the identified anomalies and
discuss the observable properties of each group, as well as the
implications for the physical properties of the quasars. Finally, Sect.
<a href="#sec:Conclusion">6</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”sec:Conclusion”}
summarizes our findings.</p>

<h1 id="sec:Data">Data</h1>

<p>The spectral data for this project were obtained from the SDSS DR16Q
catalog, which contains 750,414 quasars in the redshift range from
$0 &lt; z \leq 7.1$. The spectra were obtained using the SDSS and Baryon
Acoustic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) spectrographs from the
SDSS survey, covering wavelengths from 3600 to 10,400 Å (with good
throughput between 3650 and 9500 Å) and a resolution of 1560–2270 in
the blue channel and 1850–2650 in the red channel [@smee2013multi].</p>

</figure>

<p>Our goal is to identify anomalous quasar spectra in this dataset. To
facilitate outlier detection, we defined a “similar-looking” sample
space by restricting the rest-frame wavelength range of all spectra to
1250–3000 Å. This range captures four prominent emission lines typical
of quasar spectra: Si iv $\lambda 1400$Å, C iv $\lambda 1549$Å,
C iii $\lambda 1909$Å, and Mg ii $\lambda 2798$Å  [see
@{2001AJ….122..549V}]. With the BOSS spectrograph’s wavelength
coverage of $[3600,10400]\AA$, our wavelength window translates to a
redshift range of $z\in[1.88,2.47],$ as shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig:redshift_dist">1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:redshift_dist”}, where the yellow shaded region marks the
selected sample.</p>

<p>Initially, our analysis included all 81,780 quasars (comprising
$\sim13\%$ of the DR16Q population) within the specified redshift range.
However, this led to a systematic issue where broad absorption line
(BAL) quasars were predominantly identified as anomalies, as discussed
in Sect.<a href="#sec:Discussion">5</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”sec:Discussion”}. Additionally, running the algorithm on the
complete dataset resulted in impure groups that needed several cleaning
steps to achieve homogeneous properties amongst the group members. To
address this, we conducted our analysis using two disjoint datasets: a)
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL dataset</code> comprising 26,557 BAL quasars from the sample and b)
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">non-BAL dataset</code>, containing 55,223 non-BAL quasars. The BAL quasars
were selected based on the keyword “BAL PROB” value being greater than
or equal to 0.5 [@Guo_2019]. Additionally, a signal-to-noise ratio of
S/N $\geq4$, value of the “IS_QSO_FINAL” parameter = 1, and no ZWARNING
flag was required for all included quasar spectra.</p>

<h2 id="data-preprocessing-subsecdata-preprocessing">Data preprocessing {#subsec:Data Preprocessing}</h2>

<p>The quasar spectra from SDSS contain observed flux
$(ergs/cm^2/sec/\mathrm{\AA})$ distributed logarithmically on a
wavelength $(\mathrm{\AA})$ scale. Given the wide range of redshift, we
first corrected all spectra to the rest frame using the equation:
$\lambda_0 = \frac{\lambda_{obs}}{z+1}$, where $\lambda_0$ is the rest
wavelength, $\lambda_{obs}$ is the observed wavelength, and $z$ is the
quasar redshift. The rest frame spectra underwent a four step
preprocessing procedure (to remove noise and artifacts and prepare them
for the clustering algorithm), which included the following steps
chronologically:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Resampling: The raw spectra were resampled following the method of
@carnall2017spectres to bring all spectra onto a common wavelength
grid, specifically 1250 to 3000 Å, and trim off the excess
wavelengths. This resampling also reduced the data size by a factor
of 2. A typical SDSS spectrum, originally with a flux array length
of around 4000, was reduced to approximately 850 points after
resampling with 2 Å binning. This significantly lowered
computational costs without compromising the quality of the
information retained by the spectra.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Smoothing: The resampled spectra were smoothed using a
Savitzky–Golay filter [@{1964AnaCh..36.1627S}], with a window
length of five pixels and a third-degree polynomial. This method
effectively reduced noise without altering the length or overall
shape of the spectral array. However, it did not remove artifacts
like extremely narrow spikes in the spectra, which are often caused
by cosmic ray hits or system-induced errors, as discussed by
@newman2004mass.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Normalization: []{#process:Normalization
label=”process:Normalization”}The resampled and smoothed spectra
were normalized using the maximum flux value [e.g., @liu2011method],
as described in Equation
<a href="#eq:%20Normalization">[eq: Normalization]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”eq: Normalization”}, thereby adjusting the flux value
range for all spectra to [-1,1]. This normalization reduced the
likelihood of the algorithm identifying a spectrum as an outlier
based on extreme flux, whether high or low, expressed as</p>

    <p>::: center
$$\label{eq: Normalization}
            (F_{normalized})<em>\lambda = \frac{F</em>\lambda}{max({F_\lambda})}
        .$$
:::</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Padding and gap correction: As previously discussed, all spectra
were shifted to their rest wavelengths and resampled onto a common
wavelength grid spanning 1250 Å to 3000 Å for standardization. Due
to the varying redshift values $(z)$, not all spectra naturally
cover this entire wavelength range. Consequently, any flux outside
this range was excluded, and gaps at both ends were filled by
padding with the trailing flux value. This procedure ensured that
all spectra had uniform dimensions, which is essential for the
anomaly detection algorithms. We had 717 spectra with extended
regions of missing flux values. To “repair” these, we applied an
iterative PCA-based gap-filling method [following @yip2004spectral]
to reconstruct missing (now padded) spectral data. First, we
computed the eigenspectra by performing PCA on the available
complete (a spectrum with no missing flux values) spectra, capturing
the dominant variance structure. Missing regions in the 717 spectra
are then iteratively reconstructed by projecting each spectrum onto
the eigenspectra and refining the estimates until convergence. This
approach preserves the statistical integrity of the spectra, while
minimizing the reconstruction bias.</p>

<figcaption>Example quasar spectrum showing the max-normalized flux
before (blue) and after preprocessing (black). Note: the preprocessing

shape.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We initially attempted to utilize the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code> masks to obtain a
clean spectrum. However, these methods proved ineffective as they
removed large portions of the spectra, leading to detection as anomalies
due to the missing chunks. Instead, a simple rebinning and
Savitzky-Golay (Sav-Gol) smoothing approach, as discussed earlier, was
more effective in eliminating bad pixels and producing a cleaner
spectrum.</p>

<p>Similarly, we also tried using median normalization, median filtering to
remove cosmic rays, and various rebinning methods but could not match
the performance of the currently adopted methodology. For example,
median normalization reduced the explained PCA variance to 79% (instead
of the current 94.9%). The large noise in the continuum, especially in
the low-S/N spectra, distributes the variance across a larger number of
components, reducing the variance captured by the first few principal
components in PCA.

blue) and after preprocessing (black).</p>

<h2 id="principal-component-analysis-subsec-pca">Principal component analysis {#subsec: PCA}</h2>

<p>As discussed by @{2010ApJ…714..487S}, a spectrum can be represented as
a vector in a high-dimensional space with as many unit vectors as the
wavelength grid and the flux values being the coefficients for these
unit vectors.</p>

<span><code>BAL</code></span> (red) and
<span><code>Non-BAL</code></span> (green) datasets. In both cases, a
total explained variance of 94.9% is achieved with 20 PCA
components.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Therefore, the quasar spectral catalog can be considered as a set of
vectors in this space with well-defined (Euclidean) distances between
each vector pair. Since the performance of k-means clustering is
inversely proportional to the number of dimensions in which the
clustering is performed [e.g., @10.5120/1789-2471], we applied a PCA to
reduce the dimensions of the spectra from $\sim$ 850-dimensional
wavelength-flux hyperspace to a 20 dimension PCA eigenvector hyperspace.
The number of components was chosen such that we obtain a cumulative
explained variance of about 95%, which was achieved with 20 PCA
components. This accounted for 94.9% of the total variance, as depicted
in Fig. <a href="#fig:PCA_Explained_Variance">3</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:PCA_Explained_Variance”}. Since the total explained
variance by the PCA was high enough, we decided to retain all the
spectra irrespective of their reconstruction error. In
Fig <a href="#fig:pca_eigenspectra">[fig:pca_eigenspectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:pca_eigenspectra”} of the appendix, we show the 20
eigenvectors from the PCA decomposition, which represent the principal
components capturing the most significant variance in the dataset. These
components are crucial for understanding the underlying structure of the
quasar spectra, as they highlight key recurring patterns. Among the 20
PCA components, it is noteworthy that the second PCA eigenvector
captures the reddening component of a given spectra as evident from its
steep positively sloped shape (see component 2,
Fig <a href="#fig:pca_eigenspectra">[fig:pca_eigenspectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:pca_eigenspectra”} in the appendix). Therefore, if a
quasar has a high coefficient for the second PCA eigenvector (PCA 2), it
indicates a greater amount of reddening. In other words, the PCA 2
coefficient is directly proportional to the level of reddening in the
spectrum.</p>

<p>K-means clustering [e.g., @Bradley1998RefiningIP] was employed to
categorize quasars based on the Euclidean distances between their
eigenvectors in a 20-dimensional PCA coefficient space. The algorithm
initiates by selecting $k$ random eigenspectra from the dataset,
assuming these to be the centroids of distinct clusters. Subsequently,
all spectra in the sample are assigned to the nearest centroid according
to Euclidean distance. The cluster centroids are then recalculated as
the mean of the spectra within each cluster. This iterative process
continues until the cluster memberships stabilize, with no spectra
re-assigned in two consecutive iterations. The final output comprises
$k$ cluster centroids and the classification of each spectrum into one
of the $k$ clusters. K-means is well-suited to large datasets due to its
simplicity and efficiency. However, the algorithm requires the user to
input a predefined number of clusters, $k$. Instead of assuming this
number based on prior knowledge, we calculated it explicitly using the
elbow method on the sum of squared errors (SSE) and silhouette
coefficients [e.g., @syakur2018integration], as shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig:Optimum_Clusters">4</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Optimum_Clusters”}. The “knee” or elbow was found using
the Kneed Python module, which utilizes the Kneedle algorithm
[@satopaa2011finding] to find the point of maximum curvature, which in a
well behaved clustering problem, represents the optimum number of
clusters for the distribution. The elbow method determines the optimal
number of clusters by identifying the point of maximum curvature in the
SSE plot. This "elbow" indicates where increasing the number of
clusters yields minimal improvements in reducing error. Based on this
analysis, $k=3$ is obtained as the optimum number of clusters for both
of our datasets. Detailed cluster visualizations are presented in
Sect.<a href="#subsec:%20Results_Clusters">4.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”

<h2 id="anomaly-detection-subsec-anomaly-detection">Anomaly detection {#subsec: Anomaly Detection}</h2>

<p>After assigning data points to the three clusters, we computed the
Euclidean distance of each point from its respective cluster centroid
and analyzed the resulting distribution. Typically, spectra with
coefficients similar to the majority (considered “normal” spectra) are
positioned close to their cluster centroid. To characterize the
underlying type of each cluster’s distance distribution, we performed a
comprehensive statistical analysis. First, we visualized the data using
histograms (see
Fig. <a href="#fig:Distance_Histogram_Comparison">[fig:Distance_Histogram_Comparison]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Distance_Histogram_Comparison”}) and Q-Q plots to assess
normality. We then applied formal statistical tests, including the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, and Shapiro-Wilk tests, to
evaluate deviations from a normal distribution [e.g., see
@razali2011power]. These tests consistently indicated that the data does
not follow a normal distribution.</p>

<p>To identify the best-fitting distribution, we fit multiple candidate
distributions, such as normal, exponential, gamma, Weibull, and Gumbel,
using a maximum likelihood estimation [e.g., see @cousineau2004fitting].
We then compared their goodness-of-fit using the Akaike Information
Criterion [AIC; see @bozdogan1987model], selecting the model with the
lowest AIC as the best representation of the data. The results showed
that all the distributions were Gumbel long-tailed spreads, with a
significant skew toward higher values.</p>

<p>Given this long-tailed nature, we adopted the interquartile range (IQR)
method for outlier marking, which is robust to skewed and non-normal
distributions [as noted by
@seo2006review; @schwertman2004simple; @hubert2008outlier etc]. For each
subset of data, we compute the first (Q1) and third quartiles (Q3) and
determine the IQR as $IQR = Q3-Q1$. Any data points exceeding
$Q3+1.5\times IQR$ are classified as outliers. By setting an upper bound
at $Q3+1.5\times IQR$, we effectively identify extreme values while
accounting for the natural asymmetry in the data. The histograms in
Fig.<a href="#fig:Distance_Histogram_Comparison">[fig:Distance_Histogram_Comparison]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Distance_Histogram_Comparison”} visualize the
distribution of distances within each cluster, with the outlier
threshold marked by a dashed line and shaded region, highlighting
extreme values beyond the computed upper bound.</p>

occurs at 4 for both datasets, which coincides with the maxima of the
silhouette coefficient.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We obtained a total of 1291 and 1226 anomalies in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL</code> dataset and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Non-BAL</code> dataset respectively. From hereon, we refer to the quasars in
these samples as “anomalous quasars.”</p>

<h2 id="anomaly-grouping-subsecanomaly-grouping">Anomaly grouping {#subsec:Anomaly Grouping}</h2>

<p>Visual inspection of the anomalous spectra revealed recurring
characteristics, such as extremely sharp and narrow C iv peaks, as well
as defects like faulty spectra. To further investigate these anomalies
and derive statistical insights, we re-applied k-means clustering only
on the “anomalous quasars” sample identified in Sect.
<a href="#subsec:%20Anomaly%20Detection">3.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”subsec: Anomaly Detection”}, to group the anomalous spectra
into similar clusters, following the methodology outlined in Sects.
<a href="#subsec:%20PCA">2.2</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”subsec: PCA”} and
<a href="#sec:Clustering">3</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”sec:Clustering”}.
For both datasets, the 20-component PCA accounted for approximately 97%
of the variance. Using the elbow method, the optimal number of clusters
was determined to be 4 for the anomalies of both the datasets (see
Fig. <a href="#fig:Optimum%20Anomaly%20Clusters">5</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Optimum Anomaly Clusters”}). Hence, we grouped the
anomalies of both the datasets into four groups each. This k-mean
clustering ensured that similar anomalies are placed in the same group
irrespective of which cluster they belong to.</p>

<h2 id="secondary-anomaly-grouping-subsubsecsecondary-grouping">Secondary anomaly grouping {#subsubsec:Secondary Grouping}</h2>

<p>For both the datasets, the results showed that out of the four groups
formed, two — Group 1 (G1) and Group 4 (G4) — were identified as
“pure” groups. Here, a “pure” group refers to a population where all
members exhibit the same distinct anomaly trend or feature, without
further variation or subdivision within the group. In other words, every
quasar in Group 1 shares the same anomaly: a relatively flat, weak
continuum with a sharply peaked and narrow C iv emission line.
Similarly, all quasars in Group 4 display a strongly sloped blue
continuum with C iv and Si iv emission lines of nearly equal strength.</p>

<p>On the other hand, based on a visual inspection, Group 2 (G2) and Group
3 (G3) of both the datasets were found to be consisting of a diverse
sub-variety within the group. For instance, in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL</code> dataset, G2 and
G3 could be divided into two sub-groups each while in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Non-BAL </code>dataset, G2 and G3 showed potential to be divided into 2 and 3
subgroups each, respectively. Consequentially, we ran a k-means
clustering individually, on G2 and G3 of both the datasets.
Fig. <a href="#fig:flowchart">[fig:flowchart]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:flowchart”} in appendix presents a flowchart outlining
the steps followed by our algorithm, starting from quasar sample
selection and progressing through to the final identified anomaly
groups.</p>

<h1 id="sec:Results">Results</h1>

<p>It is important to note that, hereafter, the three classifications
resulting from the initial k-means clustering on the entire dataset are
referred to as “clusters”, while the classifications of anomalous
spectra from the subsequent k-means clustering are referred to as
“groups”.</p>

<h2 id="clusters-subsec-results_clusters">Clusters {#subsec: Results_Clusters}</h2>

<p>As shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:PCA_Explained_Variance">3</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:PCA_Explained_Variance”}, the first three principal
components account for nearly all the explained variance. Therefore, the
k-means clusters are visualized by plotting the first two PCA
coefficients. The top panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Clusters%20with%20Anomalies%20and%20mean%20cluster%20spectra">[fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra”} shows
the three clusters identified by the initial clustering algorithm,
visualized in the PCA 1 versus PCA 2 coefficient space for both the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL</code> dataset (left) and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">non-BAL</code> dataset (right). The outliers
identified as described in Sect.
<a href="#subsec:%20Anomaly%20Detection">3.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”subsec: Anomaly Detection”} are highlighted in black in the
same panel. For both datasets, clusters 1 and 2 appear relatively
compact with distinct boundaries along both axes, while cluster 3 shows
a broader spread, particularly along the second PCA eigenvector. This
spread along the second eigenvector (which captures spectral reddening)
is more pronounced in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>dataset, indicating larger populations
of reddened quasars in case of BAL QSOs.</p>

<p>Some anomalies may appear to be “within” the clusters in the 2D
visualization; however, this is a result of projecting the
20-dimensional hyperspace onto two dimensions. Points assigned to two
distinct clusters that appear to overlap in the 2D projection may
actually be distant from each other in the higher-dimensions, thereby
qualifying as outliers in the full dimensional space.<br>
To better understand the basis of clustering, we created mean or
composite spectra [e.g., @{2001AJ….122..549V}] for each cluster, which
highlight the average spectral properties of the members in each
cluster, as shown in the bottom panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Clusters%20with%20Anomalies%20and%20mean%20cluster%20spectra">[fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra”}. This
plot provides a visual representation of why the quasars were classified
into three distinct categories.</p>

<p>The mean spectrum of cluster 1 in both the datasets is nearly identical.
This is because, the strong C iv emission line overshadows the effect of
high-ionization broad absorption lines present in the quasars of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>dataset. Even when compared to the [@{2001AJ….122..549V}]
composite (see inset plots in the bottom panels of
Fig.<a href="#fig:Clusters%20with%20Anomalies%20and%20mean%20cluster%20spectra">[fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra”}), both
spectra appear nearly identical with subtle deviations between
$1300-1600\AA,$ where the cluster 1 composite of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>dataset shows
more continuum absorption which can be attributed to the absorption in
the BAL QSOs. Compared to the [@{2001AJ….122..549V}] composite
spectra, the mean spectrum of cluster 1 shows a significantly strong
C iv emission line while rest of the emissions appear fairly similar to
those in the [@{2001AJ….122..549V}] composite.</p>

<p>The mean cluster 2 spectra of both the datasets are nearly identical to
each other as well as to the [@{2001AJ….122..549V}] composite. This
shows that most of the quasars in this group are fairly “normal”
looking, which is evident by the central position of the group in the
PCA hyperspace. Similarly to cluster 1, here also the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>composite
shows slightly more continuum absorption in the same wavelength window.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the composite spectra of cluster 3 for both datasets
shows significant deviation. The mean <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>cluster 3 spectra exhibits
strong reddening, exhibiting a flat continuum and significantly less
flux at shorter wavelengths, as compared to the other cluster means and
the [@{2001AJ….122..549V}] composite. This is evident in the
normalized inlay in the bottom panels of Fig.
<a href="#fig:Clusters%20with%20Anomalies%20and%20mean%20cluster%20spectra">[fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra”}. The
mean spectrum of cluster 3 for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Non-BAL </code>dataset is much bluer as
compared to its counterpart in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>dataset. This can be attributed
to the presence of reddened BAL QSOs and FeLoBAL quasars in the cluster
3 of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>dataset, which are known for their strong absorption features
and red continua (see
Sect.<a href="#discussion:bal%20anomalies">5.4</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”discussion:bal anomalies”}).</p>

<h2 id="result:BALAnomalies">Groups</h2>

<p>As detailed in Sect.
<a href="#subsec:Anomaly%20Grouping">3.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”subsec:Anomaly Grouping”}, k-means clustering was reapplied
to the detected anomalies (points marked in black in the top panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Clusters%20with%20Anomalies%20and%20mean%20cluster%20spectra">[fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra”}),
resulting in the formation of four groups for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Non-BAL </code>datasets. The visualization of these anomaly groups (excluding
cluster members) using the first two PCA coefficients is presented in
the top panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”}, while the bottom
panel displays corresponding composite spectra for each group. The
colors of each spectrum in the bottom panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”} are chosen to
match the color scheme in the top panel. Additionally, we compared
individual anomalous spectra against cluster and group composites, to
ensure that spectra in a group are similar.<br>
As discussed earlier in this paper, G1 and G4 of each dataset were found
to be pure while G2 and G3 were divided into subgroups
(Sect.<a href="#subsubsec:Secondary%20Grouping">3.3</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”subsubsec:Secondary Grouping”}). It was found that G2
contained of a mixture of LoBAL QSOs and HiBAL QSOs with relatively flat
spectra, and reddened BAL QSOs with strong positively sloped continua.
On the other hand, G3 consisted of heavily reddened BAL QSOs along with
extreme cases of FeLoBALs. Similarly, G2 and G3 of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Non-BAL</code> dataset
also exhibited a scope of further classification with possible
sub-groups like heavily reddened, moderately reddened, Si iv deficient
QSOs etc. The subgroups created as a result of this “secondary grouping”
are as follows:</p>

  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL</code> dataset</p>

spectra, the four groups created by the second k-means clustering can be
organized as follows.</p>

<h3 id="group-1">Group 1</h3>

<p>This group features quasars with an extremely sharp and narrow
C iv emission line, consistently identified across both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Non-BAL </code>datasets. They occupy the same location in the PCA 1 versus
PCA 2 plot for both datasets, specifically in the leftmost region of the

reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”}. Hereafter, this
group will be referred to as C iv Peakers. Notably, this group also
contains contaminant quasar spectra ($\sim350)$ characterized by a
sharp, narrow artifact peak —likely caused by cosmic ray encounters—
which mimics the properties of the narrow C iv peak, leading to
coincident grouping. These cosmic ray anomalies are easily removed by
placing an upper cut on the C iv equivalent width (EW) and flux
($\lambda1549$Å) since C iv Peakers are known to have relatively high
C iv EW and flux (see Sect.
<a href="#subsec:CIV%20Peakers">5.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”

cosmic ray anomalies. After removing the artifacts, there are a total of
299 (169 BAL and 130 Non-BAL) C iv Peaker anomalies that account for
0.36% of the total selected quasars and represents approximately 12.94%
of the total detected anomalies. The only difference between the
C iv Peakers of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Non-BAL </code>dataset is the presence of a
subtle broad-absorption line blueward of the C iv emission in the
anomalies of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>dataset.</p>

<h3 id="group-2">Group 2</h3>

<p>For both the datasets, Group 2 is marked by black scatter dots, and is
located in the top-most region of the PCA 1 versus PCA 2 plot (see top
panels of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”}). These large
values of PCA 2 coefficients are indicative of strong reddening in the
spectra of Group 2 quasars.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>BAL dataset: This group is depicted by the black scatter in the
top-left panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”}, located in
the top-most region of the PCA distribution. The high PCA 2
coefficients indicate presence of strong reddening and a relatively
redder spectrum. Consequently, these quasars are characterized by a
either a flat or a strongly upward-sloping continuum with prominent
low and high ionization absorption lines. Upon secondary k-means
clustering
(Sect.<a href="#subsubsec:Secondary%20Grouping">3.3</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”subsubsec:Secondary Grouping”}) these quasars are divided
into two sub-groups:(1) Flat BALs: BAL quasars with a relatively
flat continuum. About 80% of flat BALs are low-ionization BALs
(LoBALs), which are BAL quasars that feature absorption lines from
low-ionization species like Mg ii and Al iii , along with
high-ionization lines, and (2) red BALs: BAL quasars with an
upward-sloping (red) spectrum, indicating significantly more
reddening than typical BAL quasar spectra. This group contains 425
members which accounts for 17.6% of the total detected anomalies.\</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-BAL dataset: This group is also represented by the black points
in the uppermost region of the top-right panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”}. The high
values of the second principal component (PCA 2) coefficient
correspond to quasars with relatively flat or reddened spectral
slopes. Upon performing a secondary k-means clustering
(Sect.<a href="#subsubsec:Secondary%20Grouping">3.3</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”subsubsec:Secondary Grouping”}), this group is further
divided into two distinct sub-classes: (i) Si iv -deficient quasars,
characterized by a disproportionately weak Si iv emission line. We
refer to these as Si iv deficient anomalies hereafter. A total of
328 such anomalies were identified, comprising approximately 0.4% of
the full quasar sample and 16.4% of all anomalies. (ii) Heavily
reddened quasars, exhibiting strongly positive continua slopes
indicative of significant reddening.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="group-3">Group 3</h3>

<p>For both datasets, Group 3 is shown in green scatter points located in
the top-right region of the PCA 1 versus PCA 2 plot (see top panels of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”}). The position is
indicative of large coefficients for PCA 1 and 2 both translating to
broad emission lines along with reddening continuum.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>BAL dataset: This anomaly group is placed at the upper right section
of the PCA 1 versus PCA 2 plot (see top panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”}), indicating
maximum values of PCA 1 and PCA 2 coefficients. These large values
correspond to the strong reddening and broad line features observed
in its members. Upon secondary grouping as described in
Sect.<a href="#subsubsec:Secondary%20Grouping">3.3</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”subsubsec:Secondary Grouping”}, this group was divided
into two parts: (1) red BALs and (2) FeLoBALs; the latter are a
subset of LoBALs with absorption lines from iron transitions
(excited-to-ground state), known as FeLoBALs. There are a total of
403 members in this group constituting 16.7% of the total
anomalies.\</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-BAL dataset: Similar to the group 3 of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>dataset, this
group is also present at the top right part of the PCA 1 versus
PCA 2. Upon a secondary k-means clustering this group was divided
into three parts: heavily reddened, moderately reddened, and
plateau-shaped spectrum quasars. While the heavily reddened quasars
have a steep positively sloping spectrum, the moderately reddened
quasars have a relatively flat continuum. The third subgroup here,
is a new type of quasar population, which we refer to as
“plateau-shaped spectrum quasars”. Plateau-shaped spectrum quasars
exhibit a spectral break around 2000 Å. Blueward of this break,
their spectra display a flatter continuum, while redward of the
break, the spectrum becomes steeper and bluer (see panel (f) in
Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}). These plateau-shaped spectrum
quasars are present in the lowermost section of the group’s PCA
spread (see black scatter points in the right panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:BAL%20and%20Red%20Spread">[fig:BAL and Red Spread]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:BAL and Red Spread”}) due to their relatively bluer
continua. Heavily reddened quasars constitute 60 percent of the
total population of this group while the rest 40 percent is equally
made of moderately reddened quasars and plateau-shaped spectrum
quasars.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="group-4">Group 4</h3>

<p>Shown at the bottom-most region of the PCA 1 versus PCA 2 plot for both
the datasets, group 4 members have the minimum values of PCA 2
coefficient and hence the bluest continuum. The members of this group
are depicted by red scatter points in the top panels of
Fig.<a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”}.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>BAL dataset: This group is depicted by the red scatter in the
top-left panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”}, located in
the bottom-most region of the PCA distribution. Consequently, these
quasars exhibit a steeply declining continuum toward longer
wavelengths, along with prominent C iv and Si iv emission lines. We
refer to these quasars as blue BALs: quasars with strong
high-ionization absorption lines and a steep blue continuum. This is
notable, as typical BAL quasars tend to exhibit significant
reddening. This group has 122 members which accounts for
$\approx5\%$ of the total anomalies.\</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-BAL dataset: This group is depicted by the red scatter in the
top-right panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra”}, located in
the bottom-most region of the PCA distribution. Therefore, these
quasars are characterized by a strongly downward-sloping continuum
with equally strong C iv and Si iv emission lines. Hereafter, we
call these quasars as Excess Si iv emitters. There are 227 Excess
Si iv Emitters, representing 0.27% of the total quasars in our
sample and approximately 11.3% of the total anomalies. This group
also features the identification of 13 blazars, which lack any
emission line but have a similar steep downward sloping spectrum as
a typical Si iv Excess anomaly (refer to panel (c) in
Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”

13 blazars). These blazars are present in the lower extreme of the
Si iv excess anomalies spread in the PCA eigenspace in the top panel

:::</p>

<p>We have identified ten distinct groups of spectroscopic anomalies in the
SDSS DR16 quasar catalog by applying hierarchical unsupervised k-means
clustering to the spectral PCA decompositions. BAL quasars are well
known for having spectra that differ from normal quasars due to the
presence of strong absorption features. To prevent BAL quasars from
being identified as major anomalous groups, we analyzed two disjoint
datasets: one containing only BAL quasars, called the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>dataset, and
another devoid of BAL quasars, called the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Non-BAL </code>dataset. This
approach classified 81,780 quasars into three clusters, ensuring that
quasars within each cluster have similar spectral characteristics,
regardless of their luminosities.</p>

<p>The composite spectra of these clusters exhibit several properties that
contribute to their unique separation. Cluster 1 (see top panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Clusters%20with%20Anomalies%20and%20mean%20cluster%20spectra">[fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:Clusters with Anomalies and mean cluster spectra”}) in
both the datasets exhibits nearly identical spectrum as the striking,
extremely strong C iv peak dilutes the impact of BAL signature
absorption on the spectrum. The anomaly clusters in both datasets show a
similar distribution and spread across all groups. The BAL QSOs in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BAL </code>dataset result in more diffuse and broader spectral clusters,
likely due to their strong absorption lines characteristics. In
contrast, the absence of BAL QSOs in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Non-BAL </code>dataset produces more
distinct and narrower spectral clusters, suggesting that BAL features
contribute significantly to spectral variability, particularly at the
bluer end of the UV-optical spectrum.</p>

<p>In this section, we analyze the distribution of the EWs, line ratios,
and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) for prominent emission lines.
These values are derived from the [@Wu_2022] catalog, which uses the
PyQSOFit [@2018ascl.soft09008G] software to calculate the parameters.
This analysis is done across all anomaly groups to gain deeper insights
into the underlying physics of each group. Inferences are drawn from the
analyzed distributions and attributed to specific physical properties,
as supported by findings from previous studies. A detailed
characterization of each anomaly group, including multi-wavelength and
multi-epoch analysis of individual objects, is outside the scope of this
paper and will be explored in future studies.</p>

<h2 id="civpeakers-subsecciv-peakers">C  iv Peakers {#subsec:CIV Peakers}</h2>

<p>Members of this group are characterized by an exceptionally strong and
narrow C iv emission line, accompanied by a weak, flat continuum (see
panel a in
Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}).
Fig. <a href="#fig:CIV%20Peaker%20Properties">[fig:CIV Peaker Properties]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:CIV Peaker Properties”} shows the comparison of the
C iv EW (left; a) and C iv FWHM (right; b) of the C iv Peakers to that
of all the quasars in the @Wu_2022 catalog. For this group the median
C iv FWHM is $2139\pm170\,$km s$^{-1}$, which is 0.53 times smaller than
the median C iv FWHM of all the quasars in the @Wu_2022 catalog.
Additionally, the median FWHMs of all other emission lines (Si iv,
He ii, C iii, Mg ii) are also lower, ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 times their
respective medians in the @Wu_2022 catalog.</p>

<p>In terms of EWs, the median C iv EW is $173\pm4\,$Åwhich is $\sim$ 3.7
times the median C iv EW of all the quasars in @Wu_2022. Except for the
leftmost point in the
Fig. <a href="#fig:CIV%20Peaker%20Properties">[fig:CIV Peaker Properties]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:CIV Peaker Properties”}b, which was identified as a
Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy as documented by @rakshit2021high,
the majority of the C iv Peakers occupy the high EW end of the
distribution. Despite the extremely high EWs, the C iv FWHM for these
quasars remains on the lower end of the distribution, indicating that
the extreme EW is driven by their exceptional line strength. However,
five samples display relatively high FWHM alongside sharply peaked
C iv emission (see
Fig. <a href="#fig:CIV%20Peaker%20Properties">[fig:CIV Peaker Properties]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:CIV Peaker Properties”}b).</p>

<p>::: figure*
[image]{.image .placeholder original-image-src=”CIV_Properties.png”
original-image-title=”” width=”\hsize”}
:::</p>

<p>Additionally, along with C iv, the median EW of the He ii line is about
2.33 times stronger than the median He ii EW of all quasars in @Wu_2022.
However, the median EW values for Siiv, Ciii, and Mgii align closely
with the median values observed in @Wu_2022. The flux ratio, defined as
the ratio of integrated fluxes between two lines, and the EW ratio of
any line relative to C iv for this group are positioned at the extremely
low end of the distribution compared to all quasars in @Wu_2022, due to
the exceptionally high strength of the C iv line. This suggests that the
anomalous behavior is primarily driven by the extraordinary strength and
EW of the C iv emission line. The C iv emission line stands out as the
most prominent feature within the chosen wavelength window in our
analysis for nearly all quasars (except for a few BALs), underscoring
the algorithm’s effectiveness in identifying this strong line
characteristic.</p>

<p>The C iv emission line, located at the higher end of the UV spectrum,
predominantly originates from the accretion disk near the central black
hole [@Peterson_1997]. It arises from the
$^2P_{3/2,1/2}\rightarrow\,^2S_{1/2}$ (C^+++^ ground state) transition.
As a major coolant for gas at high temperatures, well above 10^4^K
[@ferland1996high], the C iv emission is significantly enhanced.
C iv $\lambda$<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!-- --&gt;</code>{=html}1550Å has an ionization potential of 64
eV, while He ii $\lambda$<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!-- --&gt;</code>{=html}1640Å has an ionization
potential of 54 eV. Strong high-ionization lines like C iv and He ii are
typically indicative of a high ionization parameter,
$\Gamma \geq 10^{-2}$ or harder continua [see @marziani1996comparative].</p>

<p>A comprehensive explanation for the extremely high C iv flux and
equivalent line width is provided by @fu2022nature(hereafter F22), who
conducted UV-Optical and X-ray analyses of eight quasars with very high
C iv EW ($&gt;$<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!-- --&gt;</code>{=html}150 Å). Notably, two of these quasars are
present in our group. In the F22 sample, large HeII EWs are also
observed, indicating that the high-ionization BLR is receiving a
significant number of ionizing photons, consistent with a hard ionizing
continuum. F22 discusses the possibility that sources with large
C iv EWs may represent the “opposite extreme” to weak line quasars
(WLQs), which typically exhibit small C iv EWs, large C iv blueshifts,
and weak X-ray emission. Overall, WLQs are often explained as quasars
with high Eddington ratios, resulting in a geometrically and optically
thick inner accretion disk that drives outflows. The thick inner disk
together with the outflows can prevent ionizing EUV and X-ray photons
from reaching the high-ionization broad emission line region and, in
some cases, block the line of sight to the central X-ray-emitting region
[e.g., @ni2018connecting; @ni2022sensitive]. In contrast, quasars with
large C iv EWs may have relatively low Eddington ratios and minimal
intrinsic absorption. Finally, F22 concluded that the enhancement in
C iv and He ii is best explained by the combined effects of a hard
ionizing continuum and subsolar metallicity. Due to excessive
C iv emission, the Si iv to C iv flux ratio is found to be 0.13 for
these quasars, as compared to an average of 0.75 for all quasars in the
[@Wu_2022] catalog. An enhanced high-ionization recombination line like
He ii suggests a harder ionizing continuum. In combination with this
harder continuum, lower metallicity results in C iv becoming the
dominant coolant. The strength of resonance lines depends on both ionic
abundance and ionizing conditions. In a lower metallicity environment,
other lines are not significantly enhanced due to reduced ionic
abundance, whereas C iv remains prominent as the primary coolant under
these conditions.</p>

<h2 id="excess-siiv-emitters-subsec-excess-siiv-emitters">Excess Si  iv emitters {#subsec: Excess SiIV Emitters}</h2>

<p>These quasars are characterized by the presence of Si iv and
C iv emission lines of nearly equal strength, accompanied by a strongly
negative-sloped bluer continuum (see panel (b) in
Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}). A total of 227 such objects were
identified in our study. The median Si iv EW of this group is
$9.19\pm0.46$Å,  which is nearly equal to the median Si iv EW of all
quasars in the @Wu_2022 catalog. In contrast, the median EWs of other
spectral lines in this group are reduced by approximately 40% to 50%
compared to their respective median values in the @Wu_2022 catalog. For
this group, the EW ratio of Si iv to other lines—such as C iv ,
He ii , C iii , and Mg ii —is approximately twice that of the
corresponding EW ratios in the @Wu_2022 catalog. This suggests that the
overall anomalous nature of these quasars is primarily due to the
heightened Si iv emission relative to other lines. The left panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:SiIV%20anomaly%20properties">[fig:SiIV anomaly properties]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:SiIV anomaly properties”} shows the distribution of the
flux ratio of Si iv to C iv emission lines for the excess Si iv emitter
group compared to the distribution in the @Wu_2022 catalog.</p>

<p>The median emission flux ratio of Si iv to C iv in the @Wu_2022 catalog
is approximately 0.72. However, for this group, the ratio increases to
about 0.99, as indicated by the peak centered around 1 in the left panel
of
Fig. <a href="#fig:SiIV%20anomaly%20properties">[fig:SiIV anomaly properties]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:SiIV anomaly properties”}. This shift is attributed to a
combination of factors: the Si iv emission flux is 4.2 times stronger,
while the C iv flux is only half as strong. As a result, the Si iv and
C iv emission line peaks reach nearly the same height, and in many
cases, the Si iv peak even surpasses the C iv peak in this group’s
spectra.<br>
We note that the He ii emission line in this group is significantly
broader, with a FWHM nearly three times the median He ii FWHM of all
quasars in the @Wu_2022 catalog. In contrast, the FWHM distributions for
other lines (C iv, Si iv, C iii, Mg ii) closely match those of the
quasars in the @Wu_2022 catalog.</p>

<p>@nagao2006evolution demonstrated that the flux ratio of [Si iv + O
[iv]{.smallcaps}] to C iv is a key diagnostic for probing the physical
conditions and chemical composition of gas in quasars, particularly
within the BLR, as the relative role of C iv as a coolant diminishes
with increasing BLR metallicity. Our analysis reveals an
Si iv /C iv flux ratio of approximately 1.4 (compared to an average of
$\approx$<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!-- --&gt;</code>{=html}0.75 for the overall dataset). According to
@hamann2002metallicities, such a high ratio is indicative of super-solar
BLR gas metallicities. This elevated metallicity reflects the presence
of heavy elements produced in star-forming regions and incorporated into
the quasar’s environment, a process often referred to as “chemical
enrichment”. Consequently, the elevated Si iv/C iv ratio in this group
suggests super-solar BLR gas metallicities, possibly due to unusual
stellar activity near the galactic nuclei, which could explain their
anomalous nature.</p>

<h2 id="siiv-deficient-anomalies">Si  iv deficient anomalies</h2>

<p>This group can be considered the counterpart to the Si iv Excess group
discussed earlier. In these quasars, we observe reduced Si iv emission
compared to @Wu_2022 quasars, while the C iv emission between the two
samples remains comparable. Their spectra typically exhibit a
characteristic flatter continuum. Some members
($\sim$<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!-- --&gt;</code>{=html}18%) also display notably enhanced iron
emissions ($\sim44-53\%$) between 2250 and 2700 Å. The ratio of Si iv to
C iv flux for this group is 0.23, compared to 0.75 for the entire
quasars in the [@Wu_2022] catalog. This ratio, which serves as a
metallicity indicator for the BLR, points to an extremely low (subsolar)
metallicity of $Z/Z_\odot\approx0.4$. This implies that the BLR
metallicity for this group is nearly 40 times lower than that of the
Si iv Excess quasars. Additionally, we also note that the median
Mg ii integrated flux shows a substantial increase of approximately 1.8
times compared to the median of @Wu_2022 quasars.</p>

<p>The black dash-dot spectrum in the bottom right panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra">[fig:Anomaly_Clusters_and_Anomaly_Spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”

Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}), which is predominantly composed
of LoBAL quasar spectra. This resemblance arises because, in BAL
quasars, the wide absorption troughs also result in a reduction of
Si iv emission line flux, creating a similar spectral appearance.</p>

<h2 id="bal-anomalies-discussionbal-anomalies">BAL anomalies {#discussion:bal anomalies}</h2>

<p>There are four types of BAL anomalies as discussed in
Sect.<a href="#result:BALAnomalies">4.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”result:BALAnomalies”}. The majority of HiBAL quasars are not
identified as anomalies because HiBAL QSOs, which constitute
approximately 85% of the BAL population, are well captured by the PCA.
The eigenvectors effectively adapt to map HiBAL features, ensuring that
most typical HiBAL quasars are not marked as anomalies. As a result, the
four BAL anomaly groups represent a minor subset of the BAL population,
primarily due to the large number of HiBAL quasars that are included in
the dataset.</p>

<h3 id="blue-bals-blue-bals">Blue BALs {#blue bals}</h3>

<p>We define blue BALs as BAL quasars with a significantly bluer continuum
spectral index $(\alpha)$. These quasars exhibit strong C iv and
Si iv absorption lines paired with a steep, downward-sloping spectrum
resembling the Si iv excess anomalies, as seen in panel (d) and (b) in
Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}. They do not show any signs of
reddening and have significantly higher emission flux towards the
high-energy end of the spectrum, which rapidly decreases with increasing
wavelength. This is unusual of a BAL quasar as most of them are known to
be redder than a typical quasar [@menou2001broad]. Due to the absence of
reddening, they are positioned at the bottom part (with low PCA 2
coefficients) in the left panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:BAL%20and%20Red%20Spread">[fig:BAL and Red Spread]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:BAL and Red Spread”}. The Mg ii emission line is feeble
or visibly absent in most of these quasars. This category of BAL
anomalies is rare with only 103 such quasars detected in our analysis,
with all of them being HiBAL quasars. Interestingly, the spectral shape
of these blue BAL quasars coincide with the @{2001AJ….122..549V}
composite, with the only difference being the deep C iv and
Si iv absorption troughs. This can be seen as an exception to the
results by @reichard2003continuum who found all HiBAL quasars in their
study to be prominently redder than the SDSS Early Data Release (EDR)
QSOs.</p>

<h3 id="flat-bals">Flat BALs</h3>

<p>The quasars in this group have a flat spectrum with nearly the same
continuum flux throughout the wavelength range (i.e., nearly a zero
power law). This feature is indicative of significant reddening which
diminishes the flux at shorter wavelengths, making it comparable to the
longer wavelength flux [see @hopkins2004dust]. Their spectral slope is
in between the blue BALs (steep downward slope) and reddened BALs (steep
upward slope) which corresponds to their placement in the PCA eigenspace
(the green scatter points in the left panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:BAL%20and%20Red%20Spread">[fig:BAL and Red Spread]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:BAL and Red Spread”}).</p>

<p>About 80% of these flat BALs are LoBAL QSOs or Mg ii BAL quasars. LoBALs
are an important yet poorly understood class of quasars that provide
direct evidence for energetic and variable mass outflows [e.g., see
@{2014MNRAS.440..799V}; @yi2019variability; @yi2019vizier]. As noted by
@wethers2019role, LoBALs constitute about 15% of the total BAL quasar
population, with HiBAL quasars making up the majority. As seen in
panel(d) of
Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}, the composite Flat BAL spectrum
(green) is significantly redder than both the blue BAL composite (blue)
and the @{2001AJ….122..549V} composite, consistent with the findings
of @reichard2003continuum. This is the largest BAL anomaly group with a
total of 371 members out of which 15 BALs are also cataloged by
@trump2006catalog.</p>

<h3 id="red-bals-reddened-bals">Red BALs {#Reddened BALs}</h3>

<p>These quasars exhibit a strongly positively sloped spectrum with a
redder continuum spectral index, indicating significant dust reddening
(see red spectrum in panel (d) of Fig.
<a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}). This reddening corresponds to
significantly higher PCA 2 coefficients. The members of this group are
characterized by broad C iv absorption lines that strongly suppress the
blue part of the emission line, along with prominent iron absorption
features in most cases. The group comprises 276 objects, of which 60%
are FeLoBALs and the remaining 40% are LoBAL quasars.</p>

<p>The FeLoBAL quasars in this group differ from classical FeLoBALs
(another subgroup within BAL anomalies) primarily due to their narrower
iron absorption lines. Because of this distinction (and the occasional
ambiguity in identifying Fe ii  absorption due to strong reddening and
low Fe ii  strength) we opted not to combine these FeLoBALs with the
classical FeLoBALs.</p>

<p>Notably, these BAL quasars are significantly redder than the composite
LoBAL spectra constructed by @reichard2003catalog. Consistently, members
of this group exhibit even stronger reddening than the Flat BAL group
(which predominantly consists of LoBALs). This trend is consistent with
findings by @hamann2017extremely, who confirmed that BAL quasars are
more frequently associated with redder quasars and tend to have stronger
or deeper absorption profiles.</p>

<h3 id="felobals">FeLoBALs</h3>

<p>The rare class of LoBAL quasars with absorptions from meta-stable
excited states of Fe ii are known as FeLoBAL quasars
[@becker2000properties; @Choi2022]. This group consists exclusively of
extreme cases of these BAL quasars. Typical members exhibit properties
such as absorptions from over 20 transitions involving at least a dozen
elements, similar to SDSS 1723+5553, as analyzed by @hall2002unusual.
The broad-band spectral properties of FeLoBALs are thought to indicate
scenarios such as mergers, star burst, etc. [e.g.,
@farrah2010extraordinary]. In addition, “Unusual” FeLoBALs can also be
indicative of unique mechanisms such as a resonance-scattering
interpretation of FeLoBAL 1214+2803 by @branch2002spectrum.</p>

<p>The composite spectrum of the 121 members of this group is shown in
panel (d) of
Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}. Most members feature extremely
broad and deep absorption lines that significantly obscure the
continuum, resulting in a highly unusual spectrum. In the PCA
eigenspace, these quasars occupy a region similar to that of the
reddened BALs, as FeLoBALs represent some of the most extreme cases of
reddening observed in BAL quasars.</p>

<h2 id="reddened-anomalies-reddened-anomalies">Reddened anomalies {#reddened anomalies}</h2>

<p>Reddened quasars are a subset of AGNs whose spectra exhibit significant
attenuation at shorter wavelengths due to the presence of dust. This
dust absorbs high-energy ultraviolet and blue light, re-emitting it at
longer, redder wavelengths, producing a characteristic “reddening”
effect. These quasars provide unique insights into the interplay between
quasar activity and the surrounding interstellar medium, as well as the
dust content within the host galaxy [see @shao2022interstellar].
Reddened quasars are often associated with high levels of star formation
and dust-rich environments, which may obscure the central black hole and
impact the observed properties of the quasar [e.g.,
@andonie2022panchromatic]. As discussed by @hopkins2004dust, there could
be several other processes too that result in a redder spectrum such as
an intrinsically red continuum, an excess of synchrotron emission in
red, intervening absorption by galaxies along the line of sight, or dust
extinction in the host galaxy or the quasar central engine itself. In
our analysis, we identified three groups of reddened anomalies, which
are discussed below.</p>

<h3 id="heavily-reddened-quasars">Heavily reddened quasars</h3>

<p>This group consists of 165 quasars exhibiting a spectrum with excessive
positively sloped continuum (see panel (e) in
Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}); namely, they are significantly
redder continuum spectral index. Due to the reddening, they are
represented by high values of PCA 2 coefficient placing them in the
topmost region of the PCA eigenspace as shown by red scatter points in
the right panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:BAL%20and%20Red%20Spread">[fig:BAL and Red Spread]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:BAL and Red Spread”}. Nearly all members of this group
closely resemble the “too red” composite seen in [Fig. 7
@richards2003red], indicating that this group represents the extreme
cases of reddening in quasars. Additionally, some members also feature
narrow absorption lines. @hopkins2004dust showed that reddened quasars
are much more likely to show narrow absorption at the redshift of the
quasar than are unreddened quasars.</p>

<h3 id="moderately-reddened-quasars">Moderately reddened quasars</h3>

<p>This group refers to quasars with a rather constant flux throughout the
wavelength range. Visual inspection revealed that this group actually
consists of two subgroups: one with a flat continuum and another with a
convex-shaped continuum (see green plot in panel (e) of
Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}). The reddening in this group is
less pronounced compared to heavily reddened quasars. The mean spectrum
of this group traces the “dust reddened” composite of [@richards2003red
Fig. 7], which features a zero power law continuum between the rest
wavelength of 1300Å and 3000Å. They are placed aptly below the heavily
reddened quasars in the right panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:BAL%20and%20Red%20Spread">[fig:BAL and Red Spread]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:BAL and Red Spread”}, with smaller PCA 2 coefficients
representing the lesser extent of reddening. The Mg ii emission in the
members of this group is nearly identical to that of the heavily
reddened quasars. This group also contains peculiar cases of quasars
with a spectrum resembling an inverted parabola. We call these quasars
as “convex” members. The inverted-parabola spectrum of these convex
members has a peak luminosity around 2000 Å which tapers off
symmetrically toward both ends. Some members also display narrow
absorption lines, particularly toward the redder part of the spectrum.
The spectra of these convex members is identical to that of the
plateau-shaped spectrum (see
Sect.<a href="#humped%20quasars">5.6</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”humped quasars”}) quasars between 2000 and 3000Å. However,
between 1250 and 2000Å, where the plateau-shaped spectrum quasars show a
constant flux, convex members show a sharp positively sloped continuum.
In terms of visual appearance, the convex quasars are closer to the
plateau-shaped spectrum quasars, but are placed with the moderately
reddened quasars instead. This is because, in the PCA projection (see
the right panel of
Fig. <a href="#fig:BAL%20and%20Red%20Spread">[fig:BAL and Red Spread]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:BAL and Red Spread”}) the convex members are placed along
with the moderately reddened quasars (in the green group) whereas, the
plateau-shaped spectrum quasars are spatially separated and clustered
distinctively. There are a total of 93 quasars belonging to this group.</p>

<h2 id="plateau-shaped-spectrum-quasars-humped-quasars">Plateau-shaped spectrum quasars {#humped quasars}</h2>

<p>The continuum of these quasars can be characterized into two segments.
The first half (1250–2000Å) exhibits a relatively flat continuum with
broad Si iv and C iv emission lines. The second half (2000–3000Å)
rapidly falls with increasing wavelength. These quasars are termed as
“plateau-shaped spectrum” quasars. This is because the flat (or slightly
convex) feature together with the steeply sloped latter half of the
spectrum imparts a plateau appearance to the continuum (see panel (f) in
Fig. <a href="#fig:all%20anomaly%20spectra">[fig:all anomaly spectra]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all anomaly spectra”}). The members of this group have a
nearly equally strong C iv and Si iv emission peak, which is caused by
substantially less C iv emission flux as compared to a typical quasar.
The He ii strength as well as the flux between 1640Å  and 1910Å  in
these quasars is significantly more than that of a typical quasar. These
quasars also show a strong Mg ii emission line along with an enhanced
iron emissions between 2250 and 2750Å.</p>

<h2 id="machine-error-anomalies">Machine error anomalies</h2>

<p>All the anomaly groups also consistently include anomalies caused by
corrupted spectra. These anomalies often feature extended regions of
distortions or interpolation with a line connecting the disjoint
sections. One of the most consistent anomalies is the quasars featuring
a sharp narrow Dirac-Delta function-like peak caused by a cosmic ray
encounter as discussed in
Sect.<a href="#subsec:CIV%20Peakers">5.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”subsec:CIV Peakers”}. These were removed from the
C iv Peakers group by a simple threshold cut on the C iv line’s EW.
Other occasional machine error anomalies were visually identified and
discarded, as they do not contribute to any meaningful scientific
analysis.</p>

<p>The full list of anomalous quasars identified in this work is available
as a value-added catalog with this paper.
Table. <a href="#table:sample_fulltable">[table:sample_fulltable]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”table:sample_fulltable”} provides a sample list, including
the quasar name, right ascension, declination, and redshift, along with
the cluster group numbers and their final anomaly classification.</p>

<h1 id="sec:Conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Applying hierarchical k-means clustering in a 20-dimensional PCA
eigenvector hyperspace representing quasar spectra. We have presented
five broad categories of quasar anomalies divided into 10 homogeneous
groups:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>C iv Peakers: A total of 299 quasars with an extremely strong, yet
narrow (median $\sim2000$km s$^{-1}$) C iv emission line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excess Si iv emitters: Quasars in this group exhibit an excessively
high Si iv  to C iv  emission line flux ratio, nearly double the
median value observed for all quasars in @Wu_2022 catalog. A total
of 227 such quasars were found.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Si iv deficient anomalies: 328 quasars with disproportionately low
Si iv emission with Si iv to C iv flux ratio being one third of the
median ratio for all quasars in @Wu_2022 catalog.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BAL anomalies: A total of 871 quasars were identified as anomalies
with BAL profiles. These were further subdivided into four subgroups
as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Blue BALs: A total of 103 HiBAL quasars with a strong negatively
sloped (“blue”) continuum which is atypical of a BAL quasar.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Flat BALs: 371 BAL quasars with a relatively flat continuum.
Among these, 80% are LoBAL quasars</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Reddened BALs: A total of 276 BAL quasars with heavily reddened
continuum, hence, with a strongly positive slope spectra.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>FeLoBALs: These are a very rare class of BAL quasars with strong
Fe absorptions and heavily reddened continua. There are a total
of 121 such quasars detected.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reddened anomalies: A total of 341 quasars were identified as
reddened anomalous quasars, characterized by extreme reddening, as
evident from their significantly red spectral slope. They were
further subdivided into three subgroups primarily based on the
degree of reddening, as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Heavily reddened quasars: A total of 165 quasars were identified
with steep, positively sloped spectra, attributed to heavy dust
reddening.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Moderately reddened quasars: Dust reddened quasars with
relatively flat or slightly convex shaped continuum. A total of
93 such quasars were found.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Plateu-shaped spectrum quasars: A total of 83 peculiar quasars
were identified with a plateau-shaped spectrum, characterized by
a flat continuum followed by a negatively sloped continuum.
These quasars exhibit a nearly flat continuum between 1250 and
2000 Å, which then rapidly declines as the wavelength increases
from 2000 to 3000 Å.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In our analysis, we initially applied the methodology to the entire
dataset without distinguishing BAL quasars from non-BAL quasars. This
approach aimed to demonstrate what one would obtain if all spectra were
analyzed without prior classifications; that is, working with spectral
data as they are obtained by the spectroscopic surveys. However, this
resulted in groups that were not as pure, making interpretation more
challenging. Ultimately, we found that preclassifying BAL quasars
significantly simplified the process and led to much cleaner and more
distinct groupings. This highlights the importance of BAL classification
as a preliminary step when working with large spectroscopic datasets. We
recommend that future studies employing similar techniques first isolate
BAL quasars before applying clustering or statistical analyses to ensure
clearer and more meaningful results.</p>

<p>This work has significantly expanded the number of sources in each
anomalous quasar group. For example, we present a sample of 121 extreme
FeLoBALs with strong, broad Fe ii  absorption, along with an additional
127 FeLoBALs from the red BAL anomalies, where the iron absorption lines
are considerably narrower. We have developed an efficient method for
identifying anomalous quasars and classifying them into distinct
categories. The detected anomalies are presented in a value-added
catalog, available at the SQuAD website<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This approach has been
successfully applied to the rest-frame UV spectra from the SDSS DR16
catalog and is currently being prepared for broader implementation. We
applied the same algorithm to rest-frame optical spectra from SDSS DR16,
covering around 75,000 quasars in the redshift range $0.1\leq z\leq1.1$,
including key emission lines such as O iii, H$\beta$, and optical iron.
This catalog will be crucial, as these emission lines, particularly in
the context of Eigenvector 1, are tightly correlated with the accretion
rate and orientation of quasars [see @shen2014diversity]. The catalog is
currently under preparation.</p>

<p>With upcoming large-scale surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI), 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST),
and William Herschel Telescope (WHT) Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer
(WEAVE), the number of quasar spectra will increase significantly, and
our methodology will aid in identifying anomalous quasars in these vast
datasets. Additionally, our approach can be adapted for photometric
surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) survey, to
find photometrically anomalous quasars. By extending the sample size of
these anomalous quasars, this study enables the statistical analysis of
these peculiar sources, contributing to a deeper understanding of AGNs
and their diverse characteristics.</p>

# SQuAD Project Website

The Spectroscopic Quasar Anomaly Detection (SQuAD) Project is dedicated to identifying anomalous quasars from large-scale spectroscopic surveys and conducting follow-up studies on these intriguing sources. Our mission is to uncover rare quasar phenomena to enhance our understanding of supermassive black holes and the extreme environments they inhabit.
